# Smart Sync for Windows 10 Mail
A tool which flushes changes in Windows 10's email client to the server immediately.

Normally "triage" (eg: mark as read, flag, archive, etc...) changes will wait in a queue before being sent to the server. 
Closing the mail app does not flush these changes, nor does locking or shutting down one's computer.
This utility is meant to provide a work-around for that behavior.
